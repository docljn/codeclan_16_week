# Homework

## Part 1

Review your code from today's lab alongside our example solution(s) on the classnotes repo.

Compare the different approaches. Did your solution use more interfaces than ours? Did this make it better in a certain aspect? (readability, modularity etc.) You could make a list of pros and cons for 2 different approaches in a given situation / for a given class. We don't need anything submitted to github, but please submit the homework form with any comments or questions that come up.

## Part 2

Install and set up Android Studio using the instructions [](here). Android Studio often needs to download some extra tools as it sets up. This can end up taking hours if we have to do it during class, as everyone is downloading on the wifi at the same time. This is why we need to make it part of tonight's homework. If you run in to problems and the instructions aren't helping, then ask on Slack. If you still can't resolve things we can sort it out tomorrow afternoon, before we do our Intro to Android Studio lesson.
