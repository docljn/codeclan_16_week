We watched from [19:07](https://youtu.be/TMuno5RZNeE?t=19m7s), skipped from 34:43.

Started again from [49:26](https://youtu.be/TMuno5RZNeE?t=49m26s) for a couple of minutes.

The whole video is worth watching though you'll likely get more from it as you move through the course. Definitely one to re-watch from time to time.

A nice (long!) article following a specific business demand as the requirements change over time.
